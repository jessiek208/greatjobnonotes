                <h1>Why this show? Why now?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Hello my babies (trust me - we'll get there). Welcome to a blog that is hitting the scene approximately four years too late. Over the next few weeks/months, join me for a watch-along style blog covering SyFy’s two season wonder - Helix. Looking for a place to watch Helix? You’re in luck! <a href="https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/c550a7e7488b593c9d616d9884da364a/helix">It’s available here with commercials.</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>Now, you may be asking yourself: Jessie - why would you pick now, mid-pandemic in the year of our Lord 2020, to write a blog solely dedicated to the consumption of a two season show that is currently only available for streaming on Roku? Why this show? Why now? I don't have an answer for you. I just know that pressing play on Season One of Helix feels like slamming a package of gas-station donuts into my mouth while wearing sweatpants old enough to get a drivier’s permit, which is to say that it doesn’t feel “good” in a peak-physical-health sense but feels GREAT during times of unbearable existential dread.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>For the uninitiated, Helix ran on SyFy from January 2014 to April 2015. Over the course of 26 episodes, Helix takes the viewer on an absolutely wild ride. I imagine that writing sessions must have started with a communal chant of “brainstorm - no bad ideas” and ended with “great job - no notes” from the showrunner. Helix doesn’t keep its focus, and while that’s not really the mark of a good show, it just feels RIGHT this year. At the risk of some spoilers, here’s a smattering of general topics covered: lab-engineered viruses transmitted by vomiting into someone’s mouth, immortality, the illuminati (or equivalent), heavy use of air vents as a mode of transportation by a full grown man, secret twins, exploding heads, pregnant women with no teeth locked in an underground farm, an oubliette, eyeball consumption, apple-tree grafting cults, incest, a perma-baby suspended in a backpack tube, and some of the best “face acting” television has to offer.</p> 
                <br>    
                <p>Every episode of Helix covers a truly unfathomable amount of content. Just 40 minutes of Helix is probably equal to two or three episodes of any other drama on TV right now. The writers started throwing ideas at the wall, and the ideas stuck. Everything stuck. It is a wild, messy, gory, ridiculous place, and I invite you to join me in the muck. Go ahead - throw on those comfy pants and join me for a write up on Season 1 Episode 1, ‘Pilot.’</p>

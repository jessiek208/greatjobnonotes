                <p>A note for readers: I highly recommend using this as a watch-along companion. <em>Helix</em> is a phenomenon best viewed with a friend, but this show is a tough sell at a party.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>First off: A+ for the flashes of our Bloody Buddy but why are there two folks suited up in Glad trash bags sauntering down the hall so lackadaisically?</p><br>
                <p>Oldies playing on top of gross scenes is a great music choice. Into it. BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS MP3 PLAYER? Is that a Zune? Promotional considerations by…???</p><br>
                <figure><img src="../images/zune.png" alt="An older Zune mp3 player with the lyrics 'Fame and fortune is a magnet' shown as captions">
                    <figcaption>These poor folks couldn't even afford an iPod touch.</figcaption></figure><br>
                <p>Our very bloody friend from the flashbacks is writhing on the floor. He’s offered water and that’s clearly not what he wants, but this doc isn't playing by any informed consent rules, so he is going to be drinking some regardless. His throat is moving like there’s a bucket of squirrels inside it, and I HATE IT.</p><br>

                <h3>Atlanta, CDC Headquarters</h3>
                <p>We start in Atlanta, horrible highways and all. Helix does us a solid and introduces us to Billy Campbell playing CDC Daddy by framing him as a ~*typical man*~ who cannot find something in his office. Don’t worry! There’s a woman there to track it down by moving one folder. What would he do without her? </p><br>
                <p>CDC Daddy gives an engaging presentation about the history of Cholera and literally throws a deadly disease at a colleague. Is this a hostile work environment?</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/hostile-work-environment.png" alt="A woman with glasses has her hand on her chest and looks taken aback. Another woman stares in disbelief.">
                    <figcaption>Honestly, they should take this to HR.</figcaption>
                </figure><br>

                <p>Oh don’t worry. He just put alcohol in there so it was all a joke. You know what? Red flag all the same. We should all generally be wary of people who delight in making us scared for our lives.</p><br>

                <h3>Private Meeting, CDC Headquarters</h3>
                <p>WE ARE IN IT. Sargent Balleseros, AKA Sargent No Fun Bummer Town, is laying down some facts and CDC Daddy’s authority feels <strong>T H R E A T E N E D</strong>. CDC and US Government jurisdiction in the arctic isn’t a thing? No matter. There’s a retrovirus and folks are dying. We are going up there to freeze our tits off, baby! </p><br>
                <p>Uh oh. We find out CDC Daddy’s brother, Peter, is in trouble! Could it be our Bloody Buddy from earlier is this Peter man? Can we please note the face acting on display here? I love her. She is my Sweet Baby Angel.</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/face-acting.gif" alt="A woman with brown hair looks concerned and surprised.">
                    <figcaption>We don't know her name yet but she is stealing my heart.</figcaption></figure><br>

                <p>Wow not three seconds later and our Sweet Baby Angel has a name. It’s Sarah.</p><br>

                <h3>Taking Flight/Landing at Artic Biosystems</h3>
                <p>Fun banter with Doreen AKA Live-Action Pam from Archer (no credit to me - that goes to Vox) and No Fun Bummer Town. I’m sensing the start of a playful work friendship.</p><br>
                <p>Cheekbones over there clearly has some history with CDC Daddy. Feeling v thankful for Live Action Pam’s exposition of this weird brother-wife love triangle we have going on. REALLY loving Sweet Baby Angel’s confidence in her intelligence and lab skills. Not enjoying these two powerful women already being pitted against each other before we have even put one foot on the ground in this virus hell-scape.</p><br>
                
                <figure><img src="../images/biosystems.png" alt="Exterior of lab. It is a round building sunk into the harsh, snowy landscape.">
                    <figcaption>So do those windmills ever just uproot and take flight since nothing is blocking the wind?</figcaption>
                </figure><br>

                <p>LET’S PAUSE. How the actual hell did they build this lab? How did they dig out that ice and put in those wind turbines and such? You’re telling me this kind of money and logistical expense is up at the tippy top of the Earth and they are letting viruses escape instead of curing cancer?</p><br>
                <p>Right off the bat - their ride is leaving and they are getting RFID chips in their palms. BDE coming form No Fun Bummer Town who immediately cuts CDC Daddy in line for a chip. Everyone gets one and doesn’t ask any questions. Are we noticing that these things are injected under the skin but there’s no sanitation between folks during some kind of active outbreak on base? Peer pressure is a hell of a drug and even CDC personnel can’t resist it.</p><br>

                <h3>Inside Arctic Biosystems</h3>
                <p>Let’s start keeping track of things because we all know this show won’t be consistent here, bless their hearts. We are at 136 scientists and 15 support staff. I’m assuming our Mysterious Leader and the CDC team aren't included in that number, so can we call it a total of 157 people? Is that before or after the deaths? Who cares!</p><br>
                <p>CDC Daddy and Cheekbones are taping each other into their suits. They have the onscreen chemistry of two wet pieces of cardboard flapping in the rain, but that’s fine. They are taping each other A N G R I L Y and the camera is jumpy. Good thing - never would have guessed that there’d be tension there after she slept with his brother.</p><br>
                <p>Alright we are going to see Peter and - OH SHIT DUDE YOUR BROTHER LOOKS BAD!</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/peter-sick.png" alt="Man in a hospital bed. All veins in his neck and face are bulging and dark.">
                    <figcaption>He’s super pumped though. Massive gains. Never skip neck day.</figcaption></figure><br>

                <p>Sweet Baby Angel is being talked down to Ribbed Sweater Security Boi and I do not appreciate it. Doing some excellent exposition on how isolated they are, though.</p><br>
                <p>Off to the races! Our favorite Bloody Boy has black blood and wants to do some stabbin’. This man can’t drink water but he can definitely throw a couple of doctors around a room. Honestly this feels a lot like rabies. Is that a retrovirus? Why do I even listen to epidemiology podcasts if I’m not going to retain anything?</p><br>
                <p>Cheekbones sedates Bloody Boy just in time and he looks peaceful. Can someone do that to me until Feb 1st please?</p><br>

                <h3>Exploring Arctic Bioysystems</h3>
                <p>Pam and No Fun Bummer Town are in the animal lab. We’re only scratching the surfaces of weird shit with these sexless rats, Pam.</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/no-sex-organs.png" alt="A woman in a bio-containment suit holds a rat. The caption on-screen reads 'They have no sex organs.'">
                    <figcaption>God bless this actor for delivering this line with a serious face.</figcaption></figure><br>
                
                <p>Quick note - these people are def hiding monkeys.</p><br>
                <p>Flash to the other lab. WOOOOF at these body bags of black goo. I am not pleased. Neither is Sweet Baby Angel Sarah who immediately voms in her hood. Horrible day at the office.</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/body-bag-goo.png" alt="Close up of someone unzipping a white body bag. Black goo is oozing from the opening.">
                    <figcaption>You know what I love about these people? They are just as freaked out as they should be by body bags oozing black goo.</figcaption></figure><br>
                
                <p>We are back in the lab with Pam, I’m sorry - Doreen, and she is feeling VERY comfortable with her airborne virus test. No Fun Bummer Town trusts her implicitly which is very surprising and also takes off his hood. There’s some weird negging here but I ship it.</p><br>
                <p>PAM FOUND MONKEY HAIR! We are 22 minutes in and already uncovering lies.</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/naked-rat.png" alt="A naked, veiny rat is in a clear plastic container.">
                    <figcaption>Big 'Pinky and the Brain' energy.</figcaption></figure><br>
                
                <p>Alright so we switch back to Cheekbones (let’s call her Jules after all… no need to reduce her to those beautiful facial features) and our Very Mysterious Leader, Dr. Hatake. I’m getting major creep vibes from his ogling, but I also have a hard time looking away from people when I am scared that their bone structure may injure me, so he gets a pass just this once.</p><br>
                <p>Switching gears to SBA Sarah and CDC Daddy. We are watching video of our Bloody Buddy Peter talk about his day and communicate in secret hand code that only his brother would understand. There’s some casual dropping of childhood trauma and our SBA Sarah is all business. Cold.</p><br>
                <p><strong>AW BEANS! Peter escaped through the ceiling! I want the record to show that we are LESS THAN 30 MINUTES INTO SEASON ONE EPISODE ONE.</strong></p><br>
                
                <div class="two-image-gallery">
                    <figure><img src="../images/alan-shocked.png" alt="Alan stares upward in disbelief">
                        <figcaption>shocked-pikachu.jpeg</figcaption></figure>
                    <figure><img src="../images/ceiling-hole.png" alt="A jagged hole in a metal ceiling">
                        <figcaption>You KNOW he cut himself getting in there.</figcaption></figure>
                </div><br>

                <p>Damage control time. Ribbed Sweater Boi and Hatake are ruthless. They are ready to kill Peter right now with gas in the vents to save 120 others. That’s right 120. We are already down 37 people somehow. Maybe those vents only go to an area where 120 people would be? Idk that feels like a charitable interpretation. </p><br>

                <h3>Vent and Storage Whiplash time</h3>
                <p>Let’s switch gears back to our buddies Pam and NFBT. They are busting down doors and generally have a great working relationship now. The splicing of these air vent crawl scenes and monkey investigation scenes? It’s doing it for me. Pam-Doreen is finding a monkey right as CDC Daddy finds his brother. It’s beautiful.</p><br>

                <p>JUMPSCARE! Are you telling me that Peter could use a bone saw to get out of an isolation chamber but this fucked up monkey couldn’t even scratch Pam-Doreen?</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/dead-monkey.png" alt="A hairless monkey lies dead on the floor.">
                    <figcaption>This little guy never brushed his teeth.</figcaption></figure><br>
                
                <p>BIG TWIST. Some other dead dude is up in the vents. Also the guy’s arm is missing. Peter really is very handy with a bone saw and now has an active RFID chip. That’s fun. And are we really supposed to believe that CDC Daddy Alan wouldn’t make that connection right away? Does this put us at 156 people or at 119?</p><br>

                <h3>In the Lab with Jules and Sweet Baby Angel Sarah</h3>
                <p>Luckily our SWB Sarah knows a thing or two about old viruses. I can’t remember the directions to cook pasta that I read 3 minutes ago, but she can remember an article she read months ago with enough detail to be helpful. That’s nice.</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/lab-ladies.png" alt="Two women in bio-containment suits sit across from each other in a state-of-the-art lab. One looks into a microscope.">
                    <figcaption>Aw #girltalk in the lab. Just scientists seduced by their mentor things.</figcaption></figure><br>

                <h3>A Sneaky Mission with Sargeant No Fun Bummer Town</h3>
                <p>NFBT is doing some shady shit with a secret communication device, but it unveils an army of frozen in place monkeys which is METAL AS HELL. My favorite part is that he fiddles with the device and turns around only to be like “wait a minute… why do I feel like I just glanced over an army of frozen monkey corpses?”</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/frozen-monkey.png" alt="Close up of a monkey frozen solid with its mouth open.">
                    <figcaption>Medical professionals helping hypothermia patients say that you aren't dead until you're warm and dead, but this image seems to suggest that they are wrong.</figcaption></figure><br>
                
                <p>There’s some brief bomb dropping about NFBT and Dr. Hatake working for the same people. This is more boring than it should be given the implications.</p><br>

                <h3>Closing Scenes</h3>
                <p>Luckily, our team of trusty, attractive CDC doctors have determined that this old ass frozen virus is changing people. We end on a shot of Peter looking truly unhinged in a security sweater. It answers a lot of questions about the uniform choices. If this enormous man is going to steal a security uniform from a smaller man, it better be ribbed and stretch out.</p><br>

                <figure><img src="../images/final-shot.png" alt="Peter is waring a security sweater and looks unhinged. Music lyrics 'Do you know the way to San Jose' are on screen.">
                    <figcaption>Iconic look. The middle part. The ridiculous shirt. He can’t figure out how to wipe his face.</figcaption></figure><br>
                
                <p>Frankly, him dropping the severed hand after going through one door feels short-sighted. I honestly would have preferred that he put it in his back pocket for later, palm out. We end on a blood splatter though, and I am immediately willing to forgive.</p>
